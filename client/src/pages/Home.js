                    <p> Here we aim to solve your problems of scheduling conflicts between
                        busy schedules of Graduate Assistants and Teaching Assistants as well
                        as meeting the needs of faculty and course requirements. This software also
                        schedules the necessary time required for lab meetings while respecting the time
                        constraints of half and full-time graduate/teaching assistants.
