# CSC750_Project

## Objective
    -The goal of this project is to solve the needs of Professors attempting to schedule Graduate and Teaching Assistant Schedules. This software aims to generate schedules that do not have scheduling conflicts and fill the requirements outlined by the instructor.
    -These requirements include: assigning Graduate and Teaching Assignments to classes as needed = Some classes have labs, grading acitivities, and GA/TA's that must be present during class times; ensuring that schedules do not interfere with GA/TA enrolled class times.
