Hello all, hope this message finds you well.

I'm going to walk you step by step on how to get MySQL setup on your machines.
Assumptions: 
1. You already have MySQL Server installed either through XAMP or other means.
2. You know which port your MySQL server is listening on.
3. You have created a database in MySQL Server with the name "Scheduler" (Case-Sensitive).
4. You have created a user that has full permissions to the database. Keep the username and password handy.

Steps Below for Setup.|
----------------------
1. Use pip to install mysqlclient
2. Locate the settings.py file (CSC750_Project\server\src\settings.py) and open it.
3. Scroll down in the settings.py file and locate the Databases Section. Should look like this:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME' : 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
4. Change this section to include the following, 
    you will need to input your username and password to login to the database,
    you will need to input the port your MySQL server is listening on,
    you will need to input the ip address of the computer that is hosting the MySQL server (if local, use localhost)
    Make a copy of the .env-example file and rename it to .env. Then change the database credentials to your own
    
    Example:
    DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",
        "NAME": "Scheduler",
        "USER": "<Input Username Here>",
        "PASSWORD": "<Input Password Here>",
        "HOST": "<Input IP Address Here or localhost if local>",
        "PORT": "<Input Port Number Here>"
        }
    }
5. At the terminal cd into the server folder of the CSC750_Project. 
6. Run the following command: "py -m pip install python-dotenv"
6. Run the following command: "python manage.py makemigrations"
7. Run the following command: "python manage.py migrate scheduler"
8. Run the following command: "python manage.py runserver"
9. Confirm in MySQL that 7 tables were created.
10. Confirm at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api that you can successfully post information to the database.
